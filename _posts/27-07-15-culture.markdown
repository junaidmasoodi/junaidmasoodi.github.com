We always tend to have “ideal corporate” culture but sometimes we land in close culture other times a very polar to what we want. This has direct impact on productivity, resources that reach to us (branched format), communication barriers and at last rivalries and <b>standard definitions</b>  arise.

> I imagine a world where everyone has an opportunity to love their work and do their best work using their unique strengths every day.

Sadly, mostly modern workplaces with their rigid policies, procedures, measures, position descriptions and obsessive overwork cultures are doing little to encourage individuals to embrace their uniqueness and quirky ways.

In my experience the most important people in any organisation aren’t the executives at the top but the team leaders and middle managers as they are the catalyst for every success or failure a company has. Everything from communication, innovation, and change to productivity and growth, flows through the team leader or line manager.

Most people switch not because of companies aren’t productive but because of managers who try to idealise the company in their own ways. They think they are best decision makers and make it a law for everyone to follow. This turns to be the dictatorship.

According to Chuck Longanecker — founder of <b>Digital Telepathy and Filament.io</b> in his article writes about 5 Signs Your Company Culture May Actually Suck

+ Your culture relies on perks.
+ Your company has a generic mission statement.
+ Your culture only exists at work.
+ You hire skills, not people.
+ You discourage risk.

Lets take it like this, What makes coffee shop cool? atmosphere, open space, cozy chairs, dire food or non-existent service?
What makes company culture cooler, nap rooms? ergo chairs? on tap bear/tea?

It’s equally hard to answer like we are confused about coffee shop. In fact, just as the cult of productivity has bred productivity porn, so the race for the coolest, hippest culture has bred culture porn.
A culture is purely delivering the highest possible stake holder experience but we care for it less but are concerned about it more (on papers and words).

The culture isn’t about perks and we redeem them it isn’t also aboutesoteric and self-referential vocabulary like our conference halls, meeting rooms are branded internally, our positions are tagged differently, our everyday activities are labelled differently. It doesn’t make us unique, it makes us just a different tribe of same race.

While driving our wagon towards perfection and talking about culture we may be going poles apart and end up just another company. Culture is surely not perks its about what makes employees happy and not giving them chance to think of moving or if they move, they should regret about it.
