You may have heard of CSS Preprocessing before and might not have had hands on the better way of writing CSS. I was also one of the naive who didn't want to mess my WorkFlow with CSS preprocessors. I was happy writing Vanilla CSS. But then my colleague [Bassam](http://bassam.co) suggested and wanted me to abandon the traditional way and move to another level of writing quality and clean code. Yes __SASS__ is the answer. Preprocessing your CSS allows you to write more concise stylesheets which are formatted nicely and require less repetitive techniques commonly found when writing CSS code.
