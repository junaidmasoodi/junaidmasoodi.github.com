Communicating less doesn't mean you are A-Social, it simply means that you are reserved. Which is good most of time times. There are people out talking about "communication", "communication" and "communication" but is this an achievement? NO. Most of the time they dont make any sense while talking but that has been labelled as communication and you can't do anything about it.

> To be successfull in life, You need to communicate - Slogan by talkative's - Please dont miss match them with extroverts.

Well the answer lies in the fact that most of the (Almost all the) Successfull entrepreneurs are and were introverts. Many have/had even stage fear. Lets take Mark Zukerberg or Michael Bay (Director or transformers). Aren't they introverts?
Even Michael Bay walked out of the Live event without talking anything. And Zuckerberg couldn't hold his clothes in a show and took water as he had never taken it. Bill gates, Steve Jobs, Einestien to name a few are know for Introvert nature.


To be an extrovert is a great quality, thats what we should be leaning towards. 19th Century saw the great change in respect to this. The rise of Management as a subject and carrer has put impact on this very much and obviously they need to be extroverts. Otherwise they wont be able to sell anything :).

But does this apply to all walks or all fields?

The answer is simply NO.

To be a successfull manager or anything in management this is your chance, But what if you are a into something else, Like Development and not Evangelism, into Science as Scientest or similar ? It doesn't make much impact. The problem here isn't with Developers its with managers. They want you to be Extroverts because they are or they have to be.

The problem with the world is there are excessive number of managers per person. It means one country has many Prime Ministers / Presidents Won't that be a disaster?

Exactly, same is happening with many start up's. The reason for downfall of many startUp's and High number of un-satisfied Employees.
